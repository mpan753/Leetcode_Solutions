## Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ? k ? BST's total elements.

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

```python
class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, root, k):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        mid = root
        while True:
            l = mid.left
            r = mid.right
            lCount = self.nodesCount(l)
            rCount = self.nodesCount(r)
            if lCount == k - 1:
                return mid.val
            if lCount < k - 1:
                mid = r
                k = k - lCount - 1
            else:
                mid = l
        
    def nodesCount(self, node):
        if node is None:
            return 0
        stack = [node]
        count = 1
        while len(stack):
            cur = stack.pop()
            if cur.left:
                stack.append(cur.left)
                count += 1
            if cur.right:
                stack.append(cur.right)
                count += 1
        return count
```
